- **Introduction**: This plugin can help you uninstall any program in a convenient way, as long as it was installed normally. And you may notice that programs' icons are not shown in the results. It is because when your system was full of programs, showing icons can notably slow down your computer, and also **my laziness**. XD 

- **Note**: This plugin was only tested in my laptop (which runs on Windows 10 Professional 1809 Simplified Chinese Version), so it **might** have some problems while running on other platform.

**What's new in next version**: 
1. It has not been decided.
